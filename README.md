Classification model using of machine learnning 

The project is about classification problem which mainly classifies astronomical data called infrared dataset catalogs spacifically itâ€™s descriptions and ucds. 
The features are the descriptions  and the target are ucds of the infrared catalogs(databases).
Ucds :- are formal vocabulary for astronomical data which is controlled by IVOA (International Virtual Observatory Alliance).
whereas discriptions :- are the ucds discription or meanning .
One of a machine learnning classification technique Support Vector machine algorithem is used
In this case the classification model performs well when the kernel is linear.
